                        Our project name is Tic-Tac-Toe game. This game is very popular and is fairly simple by itself.
                        It is actually a two player game. In this game, there is a board with *n *x *n *squares.In our
                        game, it is 3 x 3 squares. The goal of Tic-Tac-Toe is to be one of the players to get three same
                        symbols in a row - horizontally, vertically or diagonally - on a 3 x 3 grid.
                        An algorithm of playing Tic Tac Toe has been presented and tested that works in efficient
                        way.Overall the system works without any bugs.
